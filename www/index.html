          Hi, I'm Shane.<br />I'm a digital marketer turned full stack developer.
          In mid 2016 I checked out Micheal Hartl's Ruby on Rails
          tutorial and have been coding nonstop ever since. My main focuses
          are on rails and react, but i love learning and am constantly
          expermenting with new things.

              <h4>My Wedding Website</h4>
              <p>
                I wanted to make a custom website to link to on the invitations for my
                wedding in 2017. Most of the fun stuff on the site is jQuery and CSS,
                but once I built the photobooth linked below I went back and added a in
                simple Sinatra API to accept gifs sent from the photobooth and automatically
                add them to a grid made up of the last 16 pictures.

              <h4>Comics.Town</h4>
              <p>
                This is what I'm currently working on. It scrapes some comic metadata from comiXology
                and reorganizes it into what will be a Netflix style comics browsing website that also
                pulls in buying information from various comic retailers.

              <h4>RasPi Photobooth</h4>
              <p>
                I built a photobooth for guests to use at our wedding. The code is built to run on
                a Raspberry Pi, but is written in Ruby as that was the language I was most comfortable
                with at the time I was making it. It uses the built-in Raspberry Pi camera module and MiniMagick
                to take three pictures then edits them into a branded photostrip and prints it out. It also takes
                the three pictures and a branded transparent top layer and turns them into a gif which it then posts
                to the API added into the wedding website listed above.

              <h4>Popply</h4>
              <p>
                I built this when I was first going through the Michael Hartl Ruby on Rails Tutorial. It is an app that lets
                friends join a group and then build competing brackets. Each group also has its own private chatroom and forum-type
                posting and commenting. It was originally built with The Bachelor in mind, but could be used for any weekly elimination-style
                show or sports tournament.

                <p>
                  I consider the day I first started working my way through
                  this tutorial as the first day of my life as a developer.
                  It came highly recommended on the LearnProgramming subreddit,
                  and it's entirely deserving of the praise. I really liked how he
                  first shows you how magical Rails can be by showing you that you
                  can get a running app up in a matter of minutes, but then he breaks
                  down each and every facet of Rails over the next dozen or so chapters.

                  I came to this book because I wanted to really hone up my fundamental Ruby
                  skills after being wowed by the magic of Rails. Each chapter is a rule to live
                  by when it comes to writing great Ruby code. This is what inspired me to try
                  to build the Photobooth using Plain Old Ruby.

                <p>
                  Stephen Grider has been a big part of my coding education. I highly recommend any of his
                  classes. This class really helped me grok redux once and for all. The best thing about Stephen's
                  classes is that he breaks them up into short (usually < 10 minute) chunks which makes it easy to
                  not lose focus. He also does a great job of showing common mistakes that a new developer might fall
                  prey to.

                  This was the first Grider course I took and also my first real introduction to modern Javascript. I definitely
                  struggled with parts of it at first, but Stephen does a really good job of walking through each step in depth
                  and in a way that is easy for anyone to understand.

                  I picked up this course on a whim, since people at my office had been talking about Elixir and how fast it can be.
                  It really is a neat language, and combined with the Phoenix framework, presents something really exciting. I hope to
                  stay up to date with the Elixir community, as I'd like to get more experience with it. Again, Stephen Grider made
                  learning a completely new language a breeze.
